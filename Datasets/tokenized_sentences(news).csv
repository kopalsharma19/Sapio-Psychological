telangana govt launches helpline to address psychological issues during lockdown,1
washington the lifealtering effects of the covid19 pandemic are likely to result in lasting physical and mental health consequences for many people worldwide particularly those from vulnerable populations according to a study,1
researchers from the yale school of public health studied lowincome women from new orleans us who were surveyed the year prior to and at intervals after hurricane katrina struck in 2005,1
the women reported a range of traumatic experiences during katrina many of which are similar to those now occurring during the coronavirus pandemic including bereavement lack of access to medical care and scarcity of medications they said,1
the study published in the journal pnas showed that at one four and 12 years after the hurricane the exposures most strongly associated with posttraumatic stress psychological distress general health and physical health symptoms were those most common to the current pandemic,1
ìthis pandemic is likely to have profound short and longterm consequences for physical and mental healthî said sarah lowe assistant professor at yale school of public health,1
ìthese impacts are likely to be even larger than what we have seen in previous disasters like hurricane katrina given the distinctive qualities of the pandemic as a disasterî lowe said,1
the research did not include other exposures that are taking place during the pandemic such as financial losses and unemployment which are also likely to have additional and significant impacts on public health,1

the researchers said public health messaging should provide tips for managing anxiety and fear in addition to promoting efforts to increase safety from covid19 transmission,1
supplemental health services should be provided to those who are bereaved or are experiencing clinically significant fear and anxiety related the pandemic lowe added,1

hyderabad† new delhi citizens displayed outstanding mental wellbeing index mwbi and hyderabadis werenít bad either †standing at third with 82 mwbi displaying ëexcellentí position while ahmedabad was at lowest according to a whitepaper by tra a consumer insights and brand intelligence company,1
incidentally hyderabad is the only other city where mwbi has shown a rise of 18 rising from good to excellent mental wellbeing,1

mental wellbeing is measured as a personís ability to cope with various worries they may encounter,1
it is the sum of the cognitive behavioural emotional and spiritual wellbeing of a person,1
worries may be real or imagined but the easiest way to explain worry is as ëadvancement of anxietyí,1
coping counterbalances worry and it is a personís ability to deal with responsibilities problems or difficulties successfully or in an adequate manner,1
during a serious and continued crisis like the current lockdown the coping ability may increase or decrease against worries depending on several personal and environmental factors,1

it is important for authorities to invest in more detailed studies of citizensí mental wellbeing to address these issues,1
mental health is as important as physical and economic wellbeing but being a silent problem it often gets overlooked,1

a high proportion of ophthalmologists were affected psychologically across the country during the ongoing lockdown as they are at an increased risk of close contact with the patientís eyes and face according to an online study conducted by lv,1
prasad eye institute,1
the study was conducted in collaboration with the all india ophthalmological society aios and the george institute for global healthindia to evaluate the psychological impact of covid19 on trainees and practising opthalmologists in india during lockdown,1
the virus outbreak has affected millions globally causing psychological impact such as stress anxiety depression insomnia denial anger and fear,1

on monday alone the erragadda institute saw over 90 patients most of whom were experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms and needed to be admitted authorities said,1
the institute of mental health in hyderabads erragadda saw a massive influx of alcoholics experiencing withdrawal symptoms†as the covid19 shutdown has closed bars wine shops and other sources of liquor,1
on monday alone the institute saw over 90 patients most of whom were experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms and needed to be admitted authorities said,1
speaking to reporters erragadda mental hospital superintendent dr umashankar said ìgenerally we get 40 to 50 new patients every day for all reasons but the last few days have seen a spike in alcoholics who are coming to us with withdrawal symptoms,1
on saturday there were 16 cases reported while on sunday it increased to 25,1
on monday there were over 90 cases,1
we are examining them and giving them prescriptions as required,1
if needed we are admitting them for further treatment at the institute itself he added,1
most of the people who visited the institute showed symptoms which included†restlessness lack of sleep cold sweats and headache,1
as those in the districts could not visit the hospital in hyderabad due to the shutdown the senior doctor recommended that they visit their local doctor or the government hospital at their district headquarters,1
first we determine the severity of the problem and either prescribe tablets or injectables,1
if itís a serious case we admit them and begin detoxification which brings things under control in a week or 10 days,1
if anyone has symptoms it is better to consult a doctor,1
if it is severe it is better that they get admitted in the hospital dr umashankar said,1
we have enough facilities,1
this is a 600bedded hospital,1
we dont have a problem even admitting 200 or more patients,1
we will be able to handle it,1
we have enough medical supplies as well he added,1

movement restriction may have adverse impact on mental and social wellbeing,1
featured image a medic looks at a patient who has shown symptoms of covid19 at an isolation ward in hyderabad,1
photo pti ìfew things are guaranteed in life,1
death is the most certain of them,1
but what we die of has and is continuing to changeî covid19 and the devastation it has caused across the globe was nowhere on the horizon of healthcare concerns when bbc health correspondent nick triggle wrote thus in his perceptive article,1
ironically the article published in april 2015 even had a suggestion that advances in medical sciences ñ particularly vaccines ñ have reduced the burden of infectious illnesses significantly,1
still looking back at the article as the covid19 pandemic ravages country after country triggleís point that ìwhat we die of has and is continuing to changeî is marked by extraordinary intuition,1
but it is not just the way humankind dies that is changing in the times of this pandemic,1
the way we perceive death and undergo grief has also changed strikingly,1
even the manner in which health workers relate and respond to deaths has altered dramatically,1
the increasing numbers of covid19 patients and those dying across india instil fear among not only those who are informed that they have symptoms of the disease but also among the vulnerable ñ the elderly and the ones with comorbidities,1
the process of dying is becoming one of extreme anguish not only for those dying from covid19 but their families and the ones who watch over them in the hospitals,1
the anticipation of death is also viewed with dread among noncovid19 patients those with incurable advanced illnesses like cancer endstage organ failure and other emergencies,1
healthcare workers taking care of noncovid19 patients are also going through a very tough period where they instead of saying ìwe will do everything we can and be there with you through this journeyî are saying ìwe will be able to do only this much hope you understandî for a person who is working in palliative care offering comprehensive care in serious healthrelated suffering and maintaining dignity during the process of dying this could add an overwhelming sense of helplessness and guilt,1
a fellow doctor who witnessed a covid19 patient die says that the trauma of watching the ëair hungerí of the deceased during his last moments has left a permanent scar on his mind,1
a colleague in palliative care lost her brother in intensive care in bangalore a few days ago,1
while she could get a glimpse of him before he died through a whatsapp video her mother couldnít see him at all,1
the way he died and the quick cremation that had to be carried out has pushed the entire family into inconsolable extremely painful grief,1
as a palliative care physician my colleague reaches out to patients who are dying day and night but she is still not able to come to terms with the atmosphere of† ìintense isolationî that preceded her brotherís death,1
some of the decisions that we are constrained to take in relation to patients not inflicted by covid19 is also extremely disconcerting in the present context,1
an advanced breast cancer patient had come to the hospital clearly in her last stages,1
when this prognosis became known her husband kept requesting that the patient be taken home but we were not confident enough to respect the request on account of the pandemic,1
there was no other way but to negotiate with death in the hospital,1
as is well known covid19 mortality rates are the highest among the elderly 311 in those aged 6584 and 1027 in those over the age of 85,1
among these those who have multiple comorbidities and individuals on multiple medications experience higher rates of morbidity and mortality,1
apart from the trauma caused by illness and death other losses ranging from that of livelihood financial security personal freedom and control over oneís own life have compounded mental health issues of people across the globe,1
the abject disruption of sectors like education employment transport agriculture industry and healthcare has also aggravated the sense of collective loss and grief in the community,1
indeed along with the new conditions of deaths that the pandemic has inflicted on the world the mental stress and agony that has come along with it also have new and excruciating nuances,1
and like the pandemic these psychological and psychosocial traumas are also globally felt,1
studies from countries like china and italy have reported significant distress,1
the survey in china during the initial outbreak shows that psychological impact on 538 of the respondents was moderate to severe,1
in italy covid19 related anxiety was reported as high as 739 of those took the survey,1
these studies went on to record that the situation could have serious negative effects on the mental health of the population as a whole,1
evidently these studies highlight that the risk of psychological morbidity is higher among the elderly vulnerable and women,1
for example a study in the uk the black asian and minority ethnic bame patients have a higher proportion of deaths in intensive care compared to white caucasians and 72 of males being affected compared to 28 in females,1
reports from other parts of the globe also underline that collective anxiety has become a worldwide phenomenon with the increasing infection rates and deaths due to covid19,1
in india too fears of contracting the disease along with constant apprehensions about health and safety have recorded a phenomenal rise,1
central to these fears and apprehensions are the loss of connectedness uncertainty about the future and the loss of control over daytoday life,1
consequently it has practically overwhelmed the normal skills of adaptability and problemsolving in a large number of individuals,1
the dramatic feeds and visuals propagated by a large section of the media also contribute to precipitating panic and a sense of impending doom,1
combined with all this the prolonged physical distancing and the resultant social isolation have also been found to impact the collective psyche adversely,1
so how do health workers specifically medical practitioners who are specialised in palliative care and psychosocial care contribute to this unique situation,1
to start with communicating in challenging situations discussion regarding goals of care with the patients and families is a must as those with severe conditions may deteriorate rapidly and go through a totally unpredictable disease trajectory,1
parallelly they should empower health workers in the skills that are very needed currently,1
the rapid deterioration in covid19 leaves the family unprepared to cope with the loss,1
the process of grief that follows is by and large accompanied by guilt blame anger and hostile reactions,1
there are times that this could be especially targeted at healthcare professionals and public systems,1
the stringent controls on public movement and social interaction are bound to prevent conventional mourning practices and social goodbyes leading to further precipitation of such extreme reactions,1
for large sections of indian society rites and rituals after bereavement are an essential aspect of mourning and imperative for the liberation of the soul,1
families unable to be by the patientís side at the time of death or during last rites may experience lingering mental health issues,1
thus the collective communityoriented sense of loss in a pandemic is experienced not only at the individual and family level but also at the socioeconomic and political level,1
facilitating meaningful final goodbyes and funerals conducted virtually over the phone or social media platforms may aid grieving and limit the hostile reaction,1
addressing the distress and establishing care pathways along with the general measures is possible,1
this has been recommended by palliative care globally,1
new delhi sixty one per cent indians are experiencing mental health related issues because of the uncertainty and looming financial crisis during the lockdown said a survey,2
according to the erebooting 2020 a story of covid19 and shifting perceptionsí survey by the mavericks india genz and millennials have been impacted the most with 27 per cent of genz and 19 per cent of millennials expressing that the crisis has taken a significant toll on their mental health,2
baby boomers are least impacted or perhaps better experienced and prepared to handle the crisis,2
furthermore women are struggling more than men as their workload has increased significantly with them carrying multiple responsibilities without any assistance from domestic helpers the survey added,2
the survey was conducted during the period of aprilmay collecting 600 responses via an online survey tool,2
around 46 per cent of cxos surveyed believe that working remotely will be the most significant change in the postcovid19 world,2
many cxos are exploring options to get a major portion of their workforce to work from home for a longer period of time postcovid or permanently in some cases,2
with salary cuts implemented with immediate effect across all industries the wfh proposition offers saving time and money while bringing down the real estate costs for the employers significantly,2
wfh is being touted as a winwin scenario,2
on the contrary the workforce is itching to get back to working from office with 75 per cent indians finding wfh very challenging and further blurring the boundaries between work and personal lives,2
around 90 per cent cxos expect the recovery to be slow and painful and this is likely to be reflected heavily in their decisionmaking as they try and navigate the turbulent times,2
a whopping 72 per cent indians do not expect the economy to recover in less than a year with 26 per cent being further pessimistic not expecting the recovery before two years,2
around 51 per cent of the cxos and 40 per cent of other respondents believe that china will suffer a global backlash as the world perceives that china could have responded more responsibly in handling the crisis that has gotten the world down on its knees,2
indians are tuned in to zoom and google hangoutsmeets for most part of the day besides being pushed to bring in the digital transformation to some of their most loyal habits like consumption of traditional media,2
70 per cent of the respondents are reliant on online news sources and apps and only 3 per cent of the millennials hold on to their old habits,2
fifty eight per cent respondents are likely to have increased appreciation towards sustainable environmental practices while 63 per cent are committed to leading a healthier lifestyle with a special focus on physical fitness and building better immunity,2
the travel and hospitality business is likely to take the longest time to recover as social distancing will continue to be the new normal for a while and definitely until they are vaccineprotected,2
at least 67 per cent indians are not likely to travel for the next six months unless it is absolutely necessary,2
all other cities either did not show any change in the mwbi or showed a decrease in mental wellbeing,2
